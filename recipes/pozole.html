<p>
    Pozole rojo is a hearty stew made with pork or chicken in a red–chile broth and studded with hominy (big, 
    chewy kernels of dried corn, also called pozole, which are soaked in slaked lime to remove their hull and germ). 
    The stew's base is made using the traditional method—first, two kinds of dried chiles are toasted, and then the 
    chile paste is sautéed in oil to coax out the complex flavors.
